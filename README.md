## **1. Project Scope and Goal**
 * **Problem to solve:** Enable users to generate dynamic chemical labels in accordance to GHS rulings.
 * **Minimum viable product (MVP):**
  - The website must contain a search bar which works with chemical common names.
  - Generate a PNG or PDF of the chemical searched.
  - Enable the user to download the labels.
 * **Future features:**
  - A more robust search bar which lets users search chemicals by structure or ID
  - Enable editing the labels generated
  - Enable creation of your own labels
  - Enable addition of company logos
  - Addition of more templates with different dimentions

## **2. Project breakdown**
  * **Tasks:**
    - Frontend: **TODO**
  * **Task manager:** Github projects? **TODO**

## **3. Technology Stack**
 * **Languages & Frameworks:**
  - Frontend: React
  - Backend: Python + Flask
  - Database: SQLite
 * **Tools:**
  - Version Control: Git
  - Text editor: VSCode or VIM (i would need to learn VIM)
  - Testing: Frontend: Jest, Backend: Pytest
  - Label gen: ReportLab, Pillow (should output a **.jpg** or **.pdf** file of at least **300 dpi**)
## **4. Version Control System**
 * **Git repository**
 * **Regular commits:** Commit changes frequently with meaninful messages to track progress and facilitate debugging
## **5. Development Environment**
 * Local environment: venv
 * Project structure: How would i structure the project files**TODO**
## **6. Project Plan**
 * **Document my approach:** I should write down the high-level steps and the tools i'll be using **TODO**
 * **Deadline/milestones:** Breakdown of my project into phases, rough deadlines to keep on track **TODO**
 * **Feature prioritization:**
 - 1.- Homepage structure
 - 2.- Search bar
 - 3.- HTML label code generation
 - 4.- Enable label download
## **7. Start coding and testing**
 * **Start small:** Implement core features first. Work in iterations, adding functionality step-by-step
 * **Test frequently**
## **8. Seek feedback**
## **9. Document my code**
 * **Code comments:** Make sure my code is readable and well-commented.
 * **README:** Write a README file with instructions on how to run the project, the tech stack and any relevant information.
## **10. Iterations and improvements**
* After getting the MVP, refine the project by adding new features or improving performance based on feedback.
